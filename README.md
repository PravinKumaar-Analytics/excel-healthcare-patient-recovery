# Hospital Patient Recovery Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the hospital patient treatment and recovery data using Microsoft Excel.
I built this dashboard to understand recovery trends and treatment effectiveness across different
departments, doctors, age groups, and gender.

The main goal is to convert raw healthcare data into meaningful insights using Excel dashboards.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Slicers
- Excel formulas

## 📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Total Patients: 200
- Average Treatment Cost: ₹79,698
- Recovery Rate: 54%(Calculated based on patient outcomes)
- Average Length of Stay: 16.02 days(Derived from admission and discharge data)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Department-wise recovery rate analysis
- Treatment cost comparison
- Doctor-wise recovery performance
- Patient distribution by age and gender
- Interactive slicers for easy filtering

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Some departments show higher recovery rates compared to others
- Treatment cost tends to increase with patient age
